# About
  Utilizes k-means clustering algorithm to do image segmentation.
  K-means algorithm is an unsupervised learning technique where
  given data is sorted into k clusters.
  Compresses image and constructs a colour palette from
  the given image. Colour is stored as RGB values and pie 
  chart is constructed based on on the instances of the
  colour.
# Examples
| Original Image        | Processed Image           | RGB Instances  |
